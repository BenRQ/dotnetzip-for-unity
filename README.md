# dotnetzip-for-unity #
This is a stripped-down version of DotNetZip (no BZip2/GZip support for now) with some fixes so it can be used on Unity projects, including those that target Android and iOS.

This project is licensed under the Ms-PL, packaged within this project as
"License.txt".

Thanks to Ed Ropple <ed+dotnetzip@edropple.com> for the original GitHub mirror of DotNetZip.
